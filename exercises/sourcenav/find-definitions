Using ctags, cscope, global, the lxr website, or any other method. Find a the
definitions (look for a statement with curly braces) of the following
structures that will be used on the x86 architecture. Empty declarations like
'struct mm_struct;' are not what I'm looking for.

Memory management structure: mm_struct
Task (as in processes scheduled on processors) structure: task_struct
Block device structure: block_device
General BSD socket structure: socket

For example:
mm_struct	include/memory/jedec_ddr.h

Note well, the example is wrong.
