Modify TCP Vegas to not initialize a structure.

Why? People do a lot of things in Vegas that aren't the best idea. Like eat
deep fried Oreos. Seriously, we're going to debug a kernel panic.

WARNING: Only do this if you are willing to crash your system!

Trigger the panic by building and loading the module, setting
congestion control to vegas, and initiating a new TCP connection.

make
sudo insmod ./tcp_vegas.ko
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=vegas
ssh localhost

The system will crash now.

To debug, copy function and offset from the console log:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000000000000c
IP: [<ffffffffc0194097>] tcp_vegas_state+0x17/0x50 [tcp_vegas]

Restart your system, log in, and come back to this directory.

cd tcp_vegas_broken
gdb tcp_vegas.o
	list *(tcp_vegas_state+0x17)

The line (in context) that dereferenced the NULL pointer will be printed
